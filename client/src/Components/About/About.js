        <p id ="about-text">This application was made with the idea of a central hub for exercises of all the major muscle groups. <br/> Proper form is extremely important and the improper performance of these exercises could lead to very catastrophic injuries. <br/> The exercises can be viewed without an account but in order to utilize the workout schedule feature, you must sign up. <br/><br/> After you have made an account or signed in, you can add the exercises to your workout schedule, <br/> choosing the day you want to perform the workout and how many sets and reps you would like to perform. <br/> The workouts can then be viewed in your workout page and you will be able to view each workout to confirm form prior to starting. <br/> The workouts you have added can be updated if you would like to rearrange your schedule or change your sets and reps. <br/> You can also remove a workout completely from your schedule if you would like to try another. <br/><br/> Stay tuned for more updates and features and we hope that you enjoy using this application to build a schedule that works for you!   </p>
